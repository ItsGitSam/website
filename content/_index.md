# What is the Ramblin' Rocket Club?

The Ramblin' Rocket Club (NAR Section 701 - GTRC) is one of the biggest student-led organizations in Georgia Tech's School of Aerospace Engineering. Our active membership consists of over 50 BS, MS, and PhD students working on a diverse set of projects, ranging from competitive rocketry to high altitude ballooning (HAB) for cube-satellite research. Our teams include:

- The Georgia Tech Experiemental Rocketry (GTXR) team, our annual entry into the Spaceport America Cup, the world's largest intercollegiate rocketry competition.
- The High Altitude Ballooning (HAB) team, which is developing high altitude balloons of increasing complexity with the end goal of building one to circumnavigate the globe, while at the same time providing a research platform for some Georgia Tech research labs.
- The Undergraduate Student Launch Initiative (USLI) team, our annual entry into the NASA sponsored challenge.
- The High Power Rocketry (HPR) group, which helps members build and fly their own high power rockets for certification with the National Association of Rocketry.

# How to Join?

You can start being an active member of the club by attending our general meetings, which are open to all our members and anyone interested in rocketry! The Ramblin' Rocket Club (RRC) holds its general member meetings every **Thursday** at **6:30pm** in **ESM 201** unless otherwise specified. The best way to find out if the meeting location or times have been changed is to join the RRC's mailing list and check the weekly emails.

Some semesters, the RRC also holds **advanced rocketry meetings** which cover more advanced topics of rocket engineering, such as nozzle design, liquid rocket propulsion, or aerodynamics. These meetings are generally held at **7:05pm** in either **ESM 201** or **ESM 202**. Note that both buildings are buzzcard restricted to Aerospace Engineering students after 5pm on weekdays, but any exec board member will happily let you in.

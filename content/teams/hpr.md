# Build Your Own Rocket!

High Power Rocketry helps students at Georgia Tech build and launch their own high power rockets and get certified with the National Association of Rocketry. 

First time building a rocket? No problem! Bring your enthusiasm and weâ€™ll teach you how to do the rest. Our students start applying rocketry concepts such as stability, thrust-to-weight ratios and get hands-on experience manufacturing with their Level 1 rockets. At Level 2, we help students build more complex vehicles that typically include electronics, and may include more advanced materials such as fiberglass or carbon fiber.

We attend several launches each year, up to once a month. Expect to see us at HARA launches, ROSCO launches, and SEARS launches!

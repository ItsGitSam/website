# Georgia Tech’s Biggest Rocket!

Georgia Tech Experimental Rocketry creates the largest rockets in Ramblin’ Rocket Club. In their first year, the team won their COTS category with a nominal two-stage flight to about 30,000ft at Spaceport America Cup 2019. For 2020, the team designed research vehicles to test payload, mechanical staging, an active drag system, and solid rocket motors for a 2020 flight in the 30K SRAD Category for Spaceport America Cup. Named Mr. Blue Sky, this rocket launched summer of 2021. In 2022, GTXR will be participating in the research category with a flight to 100K and in the next few years breaking the boundary of space.

Georgia Tech Experimental Rocketry welcomes students of all majors and levels of experience, the only requirement is a passion for rocketry and an interest in engineering. Existing sub-teams include structures, avionics, simulations, propulsion, payload, and finance.
